<h1>Arc and Mutex in Rust</h1>
<p>In Rust,&nbsp;<code>Arc</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>Mutex</code>&nbsp;are both types that are used for concurrent programming.</p>
<p><code>Arc</code>&nbsp;stands for "Atomically Reference Counted". It is a type that allows multiple ownership of a value, and ensures that the value is only dropped when all owners have released it.&nbsp;<code>Arc</code>&nbsp;is used to share data between multiple threads in a thread-safe way. When you clone an&nbsp;<code>Arc</code>, it increments the reference count, and when an&nbsp;<code>Arc</code>&nbsp;is dropped, it decrements the reference count. When the reference count reaches zero, the value is dropped.</p>
<p><code>Mutex</code>&nbsp;stands for "Mutual Exclusion". It is a type that provides a way to synchronize access to a shared resource.&nbsp;<code>Mutex</code>&nbsp;ensures that only one thread can access the shared resource at a time. When a thread acquires a&nbsp;<code>Mutex</code>, it gains exclusive access to the shared resource, and all other threads that try to acquire the&nbsp;<code>Mutex</code>&nbsp;will be blocked until the first thread releases it.</p>
<p>In the given code snippet,&nbsp;<code>Arc</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>Mutex</code>&nbsp;are used together to create a thread-safe shared data structure. The&nbsp;<code>Arc</code>&nbsp;is used to allow multiple threads to own the data structure, and the&nbsp;<code>Mutex</code>&nbsp;is used to synchronize access to the data structure to ensure that only one thread can modify it at a time.</p>
<p>Here's an example of using&nbsp;<code>Arc</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>Mutex</code>&nbsp;together to create a thread-safe shared data structure:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};
use std::thread;

struct Counter {
    count: u32,
}

impl Counter {
    fn new() -&gt; Counter {
        Counter { count: 0 }
    }

    fn increment(&amp;mut self) {
        self.count += 1;
    }

    fn get_count(&amp;self) -&gt; u32 {
        self.count
    }
}

fn main() {
    let counter = Arc::new(Mutex::new(Counter::new()));

    let mut handles = vec![];

    for _ in 0..10 {
        let counter = Arc::clone(&amp;counter);
        let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
            let mut counter = counter.lock().unwrap();
            counter.increment();
        });
        handles.push(handle);
    }

    for handle in handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }

    let counter = counter.lock().unwrap();
    println!("Final count: {}", counter.get_count());
}
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, we define a&nbsp;<code>Counter</code>&nbsp;struct with a&nbsp;<code>count</code>&nbsp;field and methods to increment the count and get the current count. We then create an&nbsp;<code>Arc</code>&nbsp;of a&nbsp;<code>Mutex</code>&nbsp;that wraps the&nbsp;<code>Counter</code>&nbsp;struct to make it thread-safe.</p>
<p>We create 10 threads that each increment the count of the&nbsp;<code>Counter</code>&nbsp;struct. We use&nbsp;<code>Arc::clone()</code>&nbsp;to create a new reference to the&nbsp;<code>Arc</code>&nbsp;that we can pass to each thread. In each thread, we lock the&nbsp;<code>Mutex</code>&nbsp;using&nbsp;<code>lock().unwrap()</code>&nbsp;to gain exclusive access to the&nbsp;<code>Counter</code>&nbsp;struct, increment the count, and then release the lock.</p>
<p>After all the threads have finished, we lock the&nbsp;<code>Mutex</code>&nbsp;again to get the final count and print it to the console.</p>
